## 📋 What Changed

The repository has been reorganized following **OpenAI Codex best practices for agent-driven development workflows**, with specialized agents, gated handoffs, and implementation-friendly documentation.

---

## 🗂️ New Structure

### Added Directories

#### `.agents/` - Agent Configuration
**Purpose**: Define specialized agents and their responsibilities

**Contents**:
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent registry and interaction patterns
- `project-manager/` - PM orchestration instructions
- `requirements-analyst/` - Requirements gathering
- `designer/` - Technical design creation
- `frontend-engineer/` - UI implementation
- `backend-engineer/` - API and business logic implementation
- `tester/` - Test creation and execution

**Key Files Created**:
- `.agents/AGENTS.md` - Complete agent registry
- `.agents/project-manager/instructions.md` - PM workflow guide
- `.agents/project-manager/handoff-checklist.md` - Validation gates
- `.agents/backend-engineer/instructions.md` - Backend implementation guide
- `.agents/frontend-engineer/instructions.md` - Frontend implementation guide

---

#### `docs/` - Organized Documentation
**Purpose**: Structured documentation by function

**Structure**:
```
docs/
├── 00-PROJECT/         # Project-level requirements
│   ├── REQUIREMENTS.md
│   └── CONSTRAINTS.md
├── 01-ARCHITECTURE/    # Architecture decisions
│   ├── BLUEPRINT.md
│   ├── DECISIONS.md
│   └── DIAGRAMS.md
├── 02-DESIGN/          # Technical design
│   └── TECHNICAL.md
├── 03-IMPLEMENTATION/  # Implementation tracking
│   ├── STATUS.md
│   └── PLAN.md
├── 04-OPERATIONS/      # Operations & setup
│   └── SETUP.md
└── 05-INTEGRATIONS/    # External integrations
    └── STRIPE.md
```

**New Files Created**:
- `docs/00-PROJECT/REQUIREMENTS.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
- `docs/00-PROJECT/CONSTRAINTS.md` - Technical and business constraints

**Migrated Files**:
- `BLUEPRINT.md` → `docs/01-ARCHITECTURE/BLUEPRINT.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md` → `docs/01-ARCHITECTURE/DIAGRAMS.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_RECORD.md` → `docs/01-ARCHITECTURE/DECISIONS.md`
- `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` → `docs/02-DESIGN/TECHNICAL.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` → `docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION/STATUS.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_REVISED.md` → `docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION/PLAN.md`
- `SETUP_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md` → `docs/04-OPERATIONS/SETUP.md`
- `STRIPE_INTEGRATION.md` → `docs/05-INTEGRATIONS/STRIPE.md`

---

#### `specs/` - Feature Specifications
**Purpose**: Agent-friendly, implementation-ready specifications

**Structure**:
```
specs/
├── features/              # Feature-level specs
│   └── [feature-name]/
│       ├── SPEC.md        # Implementation spec
│       ├── DESIGN.md      # Technical design
│       ├── TEST.md        # Test requirements
│       └── ACCEPTANCE.md  # Acceptance criteria
└── tasks/                 # Granular task specs
    └── [TASK-ID].md       # Individual task
```

**Note**: Directories created, specs will be added as features are planned.

---

#### `workflows/` - Workflow Definitions
**Purpose**: Define agent workflows with validation gates

**Files Created**:
- `workflows/feature-development.yaml` - Complete feature development workflow with:
  - Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Completion
  - Validation gates at each stage
  - Handoff criteria
  - Error handling procedures

---

### Updated Files

#### `README.md`
**Changes**:
- Complete rewrite to reflect new structure
- Added agent-driven workflow section
- Updated documentation index
- Added quick links to all key documents
- Removed outdated information
- Added repository structure diagram

#### `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
**Status**: Existing file preserved (will be updated in future if needed)

---

### Archived Files

**Location**: `archive/`

**Files Moved**:
- Original root-level markdown files (now in `docs/`)
- `DESIGN_COMPLETE.md`
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md`
- Other obsolete documentation

**Note**: All old files moved to `archive/` for reference, but primary documentation is now in `docs/`.

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Agent-Driven Development
**Before**: Monolithic development approach
**After**: Specialized agents with clear responsibilities

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Gated handoffs ensure quality
- Repeatable workflows
- Better collaboration

### 2. Organized Documentation
**Before**: 9+ markdown files in root directory
**After**: Hierarchical documentation structure

**Benefits**:
- Easy to find relevant docs
- Numbered folders show progression (00→05)
- Logical grouping by function
- Reduced cognitive load

### 3. Implementation-Friendly Specs
**Before**: High-level requirements mixed with implementation
**After**: Separate specifications for requirements, design, and tasks

**Benefits**:
- No ambiguity - everything explicit
- Agent can start work immediately from spec
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Testable requirements

### 4. Validation Gates
**Before**: No formal validation between stages
**After**: Checklist-based validation at each handoff

**Benefits**:
- Prevents incomplete work from progressing
- Reduces rework
- Ensures quality standards
- Clear completion criteria

## 📚 How to Use the New Structure

### For Project Manager
1. Start with `docs/00-PROJECT/REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. Follow `.agents/project-manager/instructions.md`
3. Use `workflows/feature-development.yaml` for each feature
4. Validate handoffs using `.agents/project-manager/handoff-checklist.md`
5. Update `docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION/STATUS.md` regularly

### For Engineers
1. Read your agent instructions: `.agents/[your-agent]/instructions.md`
2. Receive task spec from PM: `specs/tasks/[TASK-ID].md`
3. Read feature design: `specs/features/[feature]/DESIGN.md`
4. Implement according to spec
5. Self-validate before handoff

### For New Contributors
1. Start with `README.md`
2. Read `docs/00-PROJECT/REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. Read `docs/00-PROJECT/CONSTRAINTS.md`
4. Review `.agents/AGENTS.md` to understand workflow
5. Read your assigned agent's instructions

## 🔄 Workflow Example

### Feature Development Flow

```
1. PM reads REQUIREMENTS.md
   ↓
2. PM delegates to Requirements Analyst
   → Creates specs/features/[feature]/SPEC.md
   ↓
3. PM validates (Gate 1 checklist)
   ↓
4. PM delegates to Designer
   → Creates specs/features/[feature]/DESIGN.md
   ↓
5. PM validates (Gate 2 checklist)
   ↓
6. PM breaks down into tasks
   → Creates specs/tasks/[TASK-ID].md
   ↓
7. PM delegates to Engineers (parallel)
   → Frontend Engineer implements UI
   → Backend Engineer implements API
   ↓
8. PM validates (Gate 3 checklist)
   ↓
9. PM delegates to Tester
   → Creates tests/[feature]/*.test.ts
   ↓
10. PM validates (Gate 4 checklist)
    ↓
11. PM updates STATUS.md
    ✅ Feature Complete
```
