// Check frontend component example
// File: components/reports/ReportForm.tsx
- Does it have 'use client' directive?
- Are all props typed?
- Is state management clear?
- Are errors handled?
- Is loading state shown?

// Check backend API example
// File: app/api/generate/route.ts
- Does it validate input with Zod?
- Does it check authentication?
- Does it handle errors?
- Does it return proper status codes?
- Does it track usage (if applicable)?
```

### If Validation Fails

**Action**: Identify specific issues and delegate back to appropriate engineer

## Gate 4: Testing â†’ Completion

**Checkpoint**: Before marking feature complete

### Validation Checklist

#### Test Execution

- [ ] **All Tests Pass**: `npm run test` shows all green
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Individual functions tested
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: API routes tested end-to-end
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: Critical workflows tested (if applicable)

#### Coverage Metrics

- [ ] **Overall Coverage**: >= 80% overall coverage
- [ ] **Critical Logic Coverage**: 100% on critical business logic
- [ ] **No Untested Code**: No critical paths untested
- [ ] **Coverage Report**: Run `npm run test:coverage` and verify

#### Test Quality

- [ ] **Clear Test Names**: Test descriptions are clear
- [ ] **Assertions**: Tests actually verify behavior
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Edge cases are tested
- [ ] **Error Cases**: Error scenarios are tested
- [ ] **Mocking**: External services properly mocked

#### Critical Business Logic Verification

- [ ] **Model Fallback**: If applicable, fallback works correctly
- [ ] **Template Integration**: If applicable, templates merge correctly

#### Performance

- [ ] **Response Times**: API routes respond within acceptable time
- [ ] **No Performance Regressions**: New code doesn't slow down existing features
- [ ] **Database Queries**: Queries are optimized with indexes

#### Documentation

- [ ] **TEST.md Updated**: `specs/features/[feature]/TEST.md` documents all tests

- Coverage > 80% overall
- Coverage = 100% on files in lib/ai/, lib/transcription/
- No skipped tests
- No failing tests
```

   - **Actual Time**: X hours
   - **Notes**: [Any learnings or deviations]
   ```

## ðŸš¨ When Validation Fails

### General Process

1. **Identify Gap**: Specifically identify what's missing or incorrect
2. **Document Issue**: Create or update blocker in STATUS.md
3. **Delegate**: Assign back to appropriate agent with clear instructions
4. **Track**: Monitor progress on resolving the issue
5. **Re-validate**: Run validation checklist again after fix

### Example Delegation

```markdown
**Issue**: API endpoint /api/generate missing error handling

**Delegate To**: Backend Engineer

**Instruction**:
"Add error handling to /api/generate endpoint according to
specs/features/02-report-generation/DESIGN.md section 3.2.
Specifically:
- Catch OpenAI API errors
- Return 503 with proper error message
- Log errors for monitoring
- Handle rate limiting scenarios"
```
