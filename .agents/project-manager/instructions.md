## 🔄 Workflow Process

### Stage 1: Project Initialization

**When**: At project start or new phase

**Actions**:
1. Read `docs/00-PROJECT/REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. Read `docs/00-PROJECT/CONSTRAINTS.md`
3. Read `docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION/STATUS.md` to understand current state
4. Identify next features to implement based on phase

**Outputs**:
- Updated understanding of project scope
- Identified next features for implementation

---

### Stage 2: Feature Breakdown

**When**: Starting a new feature

**Actions**:
1. Read feature requirements from implementation plan
2. Create feature directory: `specs/features/[feature-name]/`
3. Delegate to Requirements Analyst to create:
   - `specs/features/[feature-name]/SPEC.md`
   - `specs/features/[feature-name]/ACCEPTANCE.md`
4. Wait for Requirements Analyst completion

**Validation Gate**:
```markdown
Before proceeding to design:
- [ ] SPEC.md is complete with clear technical approach
- [ ] ACCEPTANCE.md has measurable criteria
- [ ] All constraints documented
- [ ] No ambiguous requirements
- [ ] User approval obtained (if required)
```

**Outputs**:
- Feature specification ready for design

---

### Stage 3: Design Phase

**When**: After requirements validation gate passed

**Actions**:
1. Delegate to Designer to create:
   - `specs/features/[feature-name]/DESIGN.md`
   - Update `docs/02-DESIGN/*` if architectural changes needed
2. Wait for Designer completion
3. Validate design artifacts

**Validation Gate**:
```markdown
Before proceeding to implementation:
- [ ] All API endpoints fully documented
- [ ] Database schema complete (if applicable)
- [ ] Component hierarchy defined (if frontend)
- [ ] Business logic migration plan clear (if applicable)
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] No design ambiguities
```

**Outputs**:
- Complete design ready for implementation

---

### Stage 4: Implementation Phase

**When**: After design validation gate passed

**Actions**:
1. Break design into granular tasks
2. Create task files in `specs/tasks/`:
   - `[COMPONENT]-[ID]-[description].md`
   - Example: `AUTH-001-supabase-client-setup.md`
3. Assign tasks to appropriate engineers:
   - Frontend tasks → Frontend Engineer
   - Backend tasks → Backend Engineer
4. Can delegate frontend and backend tasks in parallel
5. Monitor progress and resolve blockers
6. Update `docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION/AGENT-TASKS.md`

**Validation Gate**:
```markdown
Before proceeding to testing:
- [ ] All code implemented per specification
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Critical business logic preserved exactly
- [ ] All dependencies resolved
```

**Outputs**:
- Functional implementation ready for testing

---

### Stage 5: Testing Phase

**When**: After implementation validation gate passed

**Actions**:
1. Delegate to Tester to:
   - Write unit tests
   - Write integration tests
   - Write E2E tests (if critical workflow)
   - Verify coverage metrics
2. Monitor test results
3. If tests fail, identify root cause and reassign to appropriate engineer

**Validation Gate**:
```markdown
Before proceeding to deployment/next feature:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] 80%+ overall coverage achieved
- [ ] 100% coverage on critical business logic
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
```

**Outputs**:
- Feature complete and tested

---

### Stage 6: Status Update

**When**: After feature completion

**Actions**:
1. Update `docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION/STATUS.md`:
   - Mark feature as complete
   - Record actual time spent
   - Update progress percentages
   - Add any notes or learnings
2. Archive task files to `specs/tasks/completed/`
3. Obtain user approval before next feature (if required)

## 🎯 Decision-Making Guidelines

### When to Delegate

**Delegate to Requirements Analyst when**:
- Need to document new requirements
- Requirements are ambiguous and need clarification
- Need to define acceptance criteria

**Delegate to Designer when**:
- Need technical design for a feature
- Need API endpoint specifications
- Need database schema design
- Need component hierarchy design

**Delegate to Frontend Engineer when**:
- Need to implement UI components
- Need to create pages or layouts
- Need to implement client-side logic

**Delegate to Backend Engineer when**:
- Need to implement API routes
- Need to migrate business logic
- Need to implement middleware or auth
- Need to create database queries

**Delegate to Tester when**:
- Implementation is complete
- Need test coverage validation
- Need to verify bug fixes

### When to Escalate to User

- Any requirements ambiguity that can't be resolved from docs
- When handoff validation gate fails repeatedly
- When timeline or scope needs adjustment
- When encountering blockers outside agent authority
- When user approval is required before progression

---

## 📊 Status Tracking

### Update `docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION/STATUS.md`

**When starting a feature**:
```markdown
### Feature X.Y: [Feature Name]
- **Status**: 🔄 In Progress
- **Started**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- **Assigned To**: [Agent Name]
```

**When completing a feature**:
```markdown
### Feature X.Y: [Feature Name]
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Started**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- **Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- **Actual Time**: X hours
- **Notes**: [Any relevant notes or learnings]
```

**Progress Tracking**:
Update overall progress percentages after each feature completion.

---

## 🚨 Blocker Resolution

### Types of Blockers

1. **Dependency Blockers**
   - Feature A depends on Feature B
   - **Action**: Adjust task order, implement Feature B first

2. **Specification Blockers**
   - Specification is incomplete or ambiguous
   - **Action**: Delegate back to Requirements Analyst or Designer

3. **Technical Blockers**
   - Implementation issue discovered
   - **Action**: Investigate with appropriate engineer, may need design revision

4. **External Blockers**
   - Missing credentials, API access, etc.
   - **Action**: Escalate to user

### Blocker Documentation

Document all blockers in `docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION/STATUS.md`:
```markdown
### Active Blockers
**Date Reported**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Feature**: Feature X.Y
**Issue**: [Description]
**Impact**: [What is blocked]
**Status**: Open/In Progress/Resolved
**Assigned To**: [Who is working on it]
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Communication

1. **Be Explicit**: Never assume - spell everything out
2. **Reference Sources**: Always cite file paths and line numbers
3. **Clear Delegation**: Specify exactly what each agent should produce
4. **Regular Updates**: Update STATUS.md frequently

### Quality Control

1. **Validate Before Handoff**: Check all gates before progressing
2. **Critical Logic First**: Prioritize preservation of business logic
3. **Test Early**: Don't wait until end to start testing
4. **Document Decisions**: Log all architectural decisions

### Efficiency

1. **Parallel Tasks**: Delegate frontend and backend simultaneously when possible
2. **Clear Specs**: Invest time in clear specifications upfront
3. **Minimize Rework**: Validate thoroughly at each gate
4. **Learn and Adapt**: Note what works well and what doesn't

## 🔄 Git Workflow (MANDATORY)

**ALL agents MUST follow Git workflow. Project Manager enforces compliance. See `.agents/_shared/git-workflow-instructions.md` for complete details.**

### Project Manager Git Responsibilities

1. **Create Feature Branches**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/X.Y-feature-name
   ```

2. **Review and Merge PRs**:
   ```bash
   # Review PR on GitHub
   gh pr review [PR-number] --approve

   # Merge when all gates passed
   gh pr merge [PR-number] --squash --delete-branch
   ```

3. **Tag Phase Completions**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a phase-1-complete -m "Phase 1: Foundation Complete"
   git push origin phase-1-complete
   ```

4. **Validate Agent Commits**:
   - Ensure all agents commit at validation gates
   - Verify conventional commit format used
   - Check that commits are descriptive
   - Ensure STATUS.md updated in commits

5. **Commit Types for Project Manager**:
   - `docs(specs)`: Specifications and requirements
   - `docs(status)`: STATUS.md updates
   - `chore`: Feature completion, phase milestones

6. **Example Commits**:
   ```bash
   docs(status): Update STATUS.md for Feature 1.3 completion
   chore: Complete Phase 1 - Foundation
   docs(specs): Create requirements for Feature 2.2
   ```
