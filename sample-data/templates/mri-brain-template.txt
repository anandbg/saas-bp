MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging of the brain was performed with and without intravenous gadolinium contrast.

COMPARISON: None available.

FINDINGS:
The brain parenchyma demonstrates normal signal intensity on all sequences. No focal mass, abnormal enhancement, or restricted diffusion. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. No midline shift. The posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial abnormality.
