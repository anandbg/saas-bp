## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 What We're Building

An AI-powered web application that generates high-quality diagrams and illustrations through conversational interactions. Users can describe what they need, upload reference materials (documents, images, presentations), and receive professionally designed HTML/Tailwind CSS diagrams that can be exported in multiple formats.

### 1.2 Why

We are adapting an existing Next.js SaaS boilerplate (originally built for radiology reporting) into a completely new application. The boilerplate provides a solid foundation with modern technologies (Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) that we'll repurpose for diagram generation. We will disable/mute authentication, database, and billing features while preserving them for potential future use.

### 1.3 Key Differentiators

- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language diagram requests with iterative refinement
- **Multi-Format Input**: Accept text, images, PDFs, PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and CSV files
- **Automated Validation**: MCP Playwright integration ensures diagrams meet quality standards before delivery
- **Feedback Loop**: Automatic improvement iterations (max 5) until validation passes
- **Professional Design System**: Built-in design patterns inspired by Linear, Stripe, Vercel, and Tailwind UI
- **Multi-Format Export**: PPTX, PDF, PNG, HTML, and clipboard copy

### 1.4 Success Criteria

The project is successful when:
- Users can generate professional diagrams from natural language descriptions
- All supported file formats are correctly parsed and used as context
- Generated diagrams pass automated validation 95%+ of the time
- Diagrams match the quality and style of professional design systems
- Export functionality works reliably across all formats
- The application is stateless and requires no user authentication

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Core User Stories

#### US-1: Conversational Diagram Creation

**User Story**: As a user, I want to describe my diagram needs in natural language, so that I can quickly create visualizations without learning complex tools.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I am on the main application page
When I type "Create a system architecture diagram for a microservices application with 5 services"
And I click "Generate"
Then I should see a loading indicator
And within 30 seconds, I should see a professionally designed diagram
And the diagram should contain 5 distinct services
And the diagram should show relationships between services
```

#### US-2: File Upload for Context

**User Story**: As a user, I want to upload documents and images to provide context for diagram generation, so that the AI understands my specific requirements better.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I am on the diagram creation interface
When I click "Upload Files"
And I select a PDF document containing product requirements
And I select a PNG image showing a competitor's design
And I click "Generate diagram from these files"
Then the system should parse both files
And extract relevant text from the PDF
And analyze the visual elements in the PNG
And generate a diagram that incorporates insights from both sources
And display a summary of what was extracted from each file
```

**Supported File Types**:
- Text files (.txt, .md)
- Images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- PowerPoint presentations (.pptx)
- Word documents (.docx)
- Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx)
- CSV files (.csv)

#### US-3: Iterative Refinement

**User Story**: As a user, I want to request changes to my diagram through conversation, so that I can refine it until it meets my needs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I have generated an initial diagram
When I type "Make the database icon larger and move it to the center"
And I click "Update"
Then the system should generate a new version
And the database icon should be visibly larger
And the database icon should be centered
And I should see the previous version in history
And I should be able to revert to the previous version
```

#### US-4: Automated Validation with Feedback Loop

**User Story**: As a user, I want diagrams to be automatically validated for quality, so that I only receive high-quality outputs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given the AI has generated a diagram
When the validation process starts
Then MCP Playwright should load the diagram in a headless browser
And run automated visual and functional tests
And if tests fail, extract specific failure reasons
And regenerate the diagram with corrections
And repeat validation
And stop after 5 iterations or successful validation
And only show the diagram to me when ALL tests pass
And display a validation status indicator
```

**Validation Tests Include**:
- All required HTML elements present (html, head, body)
- Tailwind CSS classes properly applied
- Lucide icons render correctly
- Responsive design works on mobile/tablet/desktop
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Charts (if present) render with chart.js
- Dark/light mode applies correctly
- No accessibility violations (basic WCAG 2.1)

#### US-5: Multi-Format Export

**User Story**: As a user, I want to export my diagram in various formats, so that I can use it in different contexts (presentations, documents, web pages).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I have a validated diagram displayed
When I click "Export"
Then I should see export options: PPTX, PDF, PNG, HTML, Copy to Clipboard
When I select "Export as PowerPoint"
Then a .pptx file should download
And the diagram should render correctly in PowerPoint
And preserve all visual styling
When I select "Copy to Clipboard"
Then the HTML code should be copied
And I should see a "Copied!" confirmation message
And I can paste the code into any HTML editor
```

---

### 2.2 Supporting User Stories

#### US-6: Diagram Type Selection

**User Story**: As a user, I want to specify the type of diagram I need (flowchart, architecture, timeline, etc.), so that the AI generates appropriate layouts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I am starting a new diagram
When I select "Flowchart" from the diagram type dropdown
And I describe my process flow
Then the generated diagram should use flowchart conventions
And include decision diamonds, process rectangles, and arrows
```

**Supported Diagram Types**:
- Flowcharts
- System architecture diagrams
- Entity-relationship diagrams
- Timelines
- Organizational charts
- Wireframes/mockups
- Data flow diagrams
- Network diagrams
- Mind maps
- Infographics

#### US-7: Style Customization

**User Story**: As a user, I want to request specific visual styles (dark mode, color schemes, fonts), so that diagrams match my brand or preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I am generating a diagram
When I specify "Use dark mode with a purple accent color"
Then the generated diagram should have a dark background
And use purple for primary interactive elements
And maintain readability and contrast
```

#### US-8: Diagram History (Session-Based)

**User Story**: As a user, I want to see my recent diagrams in the current session, so that I can quickly access and iterate on them.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given I have generated 3 diagrams in my current session
When I navigate to "Recent Diagrams"
Then I should see thumbnails of all 3 diagrams
And clicking a thumbnail should load that diagram
And I should be able to continue iterating on any of them
When I refresh the page or close the browser
Then the history should be cleared (stateless)
```
