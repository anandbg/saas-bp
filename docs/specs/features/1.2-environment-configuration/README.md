# Feature 1.2: Environment Configuration - Specification Package

## üìÅ Document Overview

This directory contains the complete specification for Feature 1.2: Environment Configuration, which establishes the foundation for all external service integrations in the Radiology Reporting App.

---

## üìÑ Files in This Package

### 1. SPEC.md (Main Specification)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive technical specification for environment configuration
**Size:** ~700 lines
**Sections:**

- Overview and dependencies
- Technical approach
- Environment variables required (all 56 variables)
- Validation steps and script behavior
- Acceptance criteria (summary)
- Success metrics
- Implementation notes
- Risk assessment

**Key Highlights:**

- Documents all required environment variables for Phase 1
- Details the verification script behavior (427 lines analyzed)
- Identifies that verify-setup.sh needs Stripe updates (currently references Outseta)
- Provides format validation rules for each credential type
- Maps each variable to its required phase

### 2. ACCEPTANCE.md (Acceptance Criteria)

**Purpose:** Detailed, testable acceptance criteria for feature completion
**Size:** ~850 lines
**Contains:** 10 comprehensive acceptance criteria:

1. **AC-1:** Environment File Creation
2. **AC-2:** Git Ignore Protection
3. **AC-3:** Required Variable Validation
4. **AC-4:** API Connectivity Validation
5. **AC-5:** Model Availability Check
6. **AC-6:** Optional Services Handling
7. **AC-7:** Verification Script Success
8. **AC-8:** Verification Script Failure Handling
9. **AC-9:** Next.js Environment Loading
10. **AC-10:** Vercel Deployment Readiness

**Each criterion includes:**

- User story
- Given-When-Then scenarios
- Validation steps (bash commands)
- Success criteria checklist

## üéØ Quick Reference

### What This Feature Does

Sets up environment configuration for:

- ‚úÖ Application settings (URL, Node environment)
- ‚úÖ Supabase (database & auth) - 3 variables
- ‚úÖ OpenAI (AI models) - 1 variable
- ‚úÖ Stripe (billing) - 4 variables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional services (Deepgram, Google, Sentry) - 6 variables

**Total:** 14 required + 6 optional = 20 environment variables

### Time Estimate

**1 hour** (excluding external credential acquisition time)

### Dependencies

- **Prerequisite:** Feature 1.1 (Project Setup) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Blocks:** Features 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.2, 2.3 (all require credentials)

## üöÄ How to Use This Specification

### For Reviewers

1. Read SPEC.md for technical approach
2. Review ACCEPTANCE.md for testable criteria
3. Verify all 10 acceptance criteria are measurable
4. Check that security constraints are met

### For Implementers

1. Start with SPEC.md "Technical Approach" section
2. Follow "Order of Operations" in Implementation Notes
3. Use ACCEPTANCE.md as test-driven development guide
4. Validate each AC before moving to next

### For Testers

1. Use ACCEPTANCE.md as test plan
2. Run validation steps for each AC
3. Verify success criteria checklist
4. Confirm "Definition of Done" is met

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security Critical

- **NEVER commit `.env.local` or `credentials.env` to git**
- **NEVER expose server-only keys with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix**
- Service role keys, secret keys, and webhook secrets must remain server-side only

### Known Issues to Address

1. **Outseta ‚Üí Stripe:** The verify-setup.sh script (lines 265-286) still validates Outseta credentials. This must be updated to validate Stripe credentials instead.

2. **Model Availability:** GPT-5 and O3 may not be available to all OpenAI accounts. The script correctly handles this with warnings (not failures) and confirms fallback models.

3. **External Dependency:** Credential acquisition from services (Supabase, OpenAI, Stripe) takes 15-30 minutes. This is NOT included in the 1-hour feature estimate.

### Validation Strategy

The feature uses a comprehensive bash script (`./scripts/verify-setup.sh`) that:

- ‚úÖ Checks all required variables are set
- ‚úÖ Validates credential formats
- ‚úÖ Tests API connectivity
- ‚úÖ Checks model availability
- ‚úÖ Handles optional services gracefully
- ‚úÖ Provides clear pass/fail output
- ‚úÖ Exits with appropriate status codes
